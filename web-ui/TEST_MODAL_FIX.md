# Modal Fix Test Results

## Issue Fixed
The runtime error "handleRemoveFromCollection is not defined" has been resolved by removing the undefined function references from ResourceFeed.jsx (lines 209-210).

## Changes Made
In ResourceFeed.jsx, the `openResource` call was updated to remove the undefined functions:

```javascript
// Before (causing error):
openResource(resource, {
  context: context,
  resources: resources,
  currentIndex: index,
  contextData: {
    searchParams: { query: searchQuery, filters: advancedFilters },
    activeCollection: activeCollection,
    collectionBarHeight: collectionBarHeight,
    onAddToCollection: handleAddToCollection,      // REMOVED - undefined
    onRemoveFromCollection: handleRemoveFromCollection  // REMOVED - undefined
  }
})

// After (fixed):
openResource(resource, {
  context: context,
  resources: resources,
  currentIndex: index,
  contextData: {
    searchParams: { query: searchQuery, filters: advancedFilters },
    activeCollection: activeCollection,
    collectionBarHeight: collectionBarHeight
  }
})
```

## Expected Behavior
1. Clicking on a resource in the browse page should now open the modal without errors
2. The modal should display with all features working:
   - Video playback for video resources
   - Metadata panel with info button toggle
   - Collection bar at the bottom
   - Navigation between resources in the same context

## Testing Instructions
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3004/
2. Click on any resource thumbnail
3. Verify the modal opens without console errors
4. Test the info button to toggle metadata panel
5. For video resources, verify video playback works
6. Use arrow keys or navigation buttons to move between resources
