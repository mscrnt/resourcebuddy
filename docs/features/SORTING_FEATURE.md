# Sorting Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added comprehensive sorting functionality to RS Art Station based on ResourceSpace's sorting options.

## Sort Options Available

1. **Relevance** - Most relevant results first (search results)
2. **Date** - By date field (typically creation date)
3. **Modified** - Recently modified resources first
4. **Resource ID** - By resource number (newest first when DESC)
5. **Popularity** - Most popular/viewed resources first
6. **Rating** - Highest rated resources first
7. **Title** - Alphabetical by title
8. **Resource Type** - Group by resource type
9. **Archive Status** - By archive state (active, archived, etc.)
10. **Country** - By country field (if available)
11. **Collection** - Special sort for collection order (only in collections)

## Implementation Details

### Components Created
- **SortDropdown.jsx** - Reusable dropdown component with:
  - Icon for each sort type
  - Description of sort behavior
  - Ascending/Descending toggle
  - Smart defaults per sort type

### Pages Updated
1. **HomePage** - Default sort by Resource ID DESC (newest first)
2. **SearchPage** - Default sort by Relevance DESC
3. **CollectionsPage** - Default sort by Collection order ASC

### Features
- Visual icons for each sort type
- One-click sort direction toggle
- Automatic sort direction defaults:
  - DESC for: relevance, date, modified, resourceid, popularity, rating
  - ASC for: title, resourcetype, status, country, collection
- Smooth animations and hover effects

## API Integration
The sort parameters are passed to ResourceSpace API as:
- `order_by` - The sort field
- `sort` - Direction (ASC or DESC)

ResourceSpace handles the actual sorting logic server-side, ensuring consistent behavior with the main application.

## Usage
Users can now:
1. Click the sort dropdown in the top-right of resource grids
2. Select a sort option
3. Toggle between ascending/descending with the arrow button
4. See results update immediately

This provides a familiar sorting experience matching ResourceSpace while maintaining the modern UI design of RS Art Station.
