# Upload Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Metadata Field ID Format
- Changed from `field8` to numeric `8` for consistency
- ResourceSpace API expects numeric field IDs in metadata

### 2. Removed Redundant API Call
- Metadata is sent during `create_resource`, no need to call `updateResourceData` afterwards
- Only node-based fields (comma-separated IDs) need separate handling via `addResourceNodes`

### 3. Backend Upload Implementation
- Fixed multipart upload to match ResourceSpace API documentation
- Proper form structure: query, sign, user, file
- Handles 204 success response correctly

### 4. Upload Workflow
1. User selects resource type (determines available fields)
2. User enters metadata BEFORE upload
3. System creates resource with metadata in single call
4. System uploads file to created resource
5. System handles node fields and relationships

## Current Working Flow

1. **Drag & Drop** â†’ Modal opens
2. **Step 1**: Preview files, select collection/relationships
3. **Step 2**: Select resource type, enter metadata
4. **Step 3**: Upload progress (create resource + upload file)
5. **Step 4**: Show results

## API Calls Made

1. `get_resource_types` - Load types for selector
2. `get_resource_type_fields` - Get fields for selected type
3. `create_resource` - Create with initial metadata
4. `upload_multipart` - Upload file content
5. `add_resource_nodes` - Add node-based field values (if any)
6. `add_resource_to_collection` - Add to collection (if selected)

## Key Points

- Metadata is included in `create_resource` call
- No need for separate `update_resource_data` call
- Field IDs should be numeric (not prefixed with "field")
- Resource type selection is required before metadata entry
- Upload happens AFTER metadata is collected
