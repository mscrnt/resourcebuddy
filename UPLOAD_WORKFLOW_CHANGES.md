# Upload Workflow Changes Summary

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Fixed Upload Flow
- Resources are created first with `create_resource` API
- Files are then uploaded to the created resource using `upload_multipart`
- Proper implementation of ResourceSpace multipart upload API according to documentation

### 2. Resource Type Selection
- Added resource type selector at the top of metadata page
- Auto-detects initial resource type based on file extension
- User can override the auto-detected type
- Resource type determines which metadata fields are available

### 3. Multi-Step Workflow
1. **Step 1: Files & Options**
   - Preview files grouped by detected type
   - Select collection, relationships
   
2. **Step 2: Metadata** (NEW - happens BEFORE upload)
   - Select resource type (required)
   - Choose metadata entry mode (locked vs individual)
   - Enter metadata fields based on selected resource type
   
3. **Step 3: Upload Progress**
   - Creates resources with metadata
   - Uploads files
   - Shows progress for each file
   
4. **Step 4: Results**
   - Shows successfully uploaded resources
   - Option to view all in search

### 4. Backend Upload Fix
Fixed the multipart upload implementation to match ResourceSpace API docs:
- Proper query string structure
- File NOT included in signature
- Form data includes: query, sign, user, file
- Handles proper response codes (204 for success)

### 5. Frontend Improvements
- Resource type utilities for extension mapping
- File grouping by type in preview
- Proper icons for different file types
- Validation requires resource type selection before upload

## API Workflow

1. `get_resource_types()` - Load available types
2. `get_resource_type_fields()` - Get fields for selected type
3. `create_resource()` - Create with metadata
4. `upload_multipart()` - Upload file to resource
5. `add_resource_nodes()` - Add node-based fields
6. `add_resource_to_collection()` - Add to collection
7. `relate_resources()` - Create relationships

## Testing

Test the upload by:
1. Dragging files onto the page
2. Selecting a resource type in metadata step
3. Entering metadata
4. Uploading files

The system now properly collects metadata BEFORE creating resources, matching the ResourceSpace workflow.
